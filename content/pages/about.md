### R. Kyle Norris

#### Automation Engineer | Data Analyst | Full-Stack Developer

With over 7 years of experience in SQL, PowerShell, Python, and .NET, I specialize in reverse-engineering undocumented systems and automating complex enterprise workflows.

The arc of my career so far exemplifies my dedication to growth and excellence in data-driven decision-making. With a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing, I blend analytical prowess with creative problem-solving, ensuring that complex data is translated into actionable business insights.

Modernizing business intelligence systems in a professional capacity with ***DGF***, I have effectively leveraged Python, SQL, PowerShell, and C# to enhance reporting solutions and drive process improvements. My journey reflects a steadfast commitment to automating and refining data processes while fostering a collaborative environment where my team thrives on innovation, efficiency, and clear and precise communication.

#### Professional Philosophy

I believe in "Orchestration vs. Engine"—using the right tool for the job. I use **PowerShell** for user-facing CLI logic and **C#** for performance-critical data handling; I use **Python and SQL Server** queries to create and automate critical data dashboards. My background with a **BA in English** ensures that my technical solutions are backed by high-quality, standardized documentation as well as clearly, explicitly communicated requirements created in-concert with stake holders.
