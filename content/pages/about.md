# R. Kyle Norris

**Data and Application Analyst | Automation Engineer**

[cite_start]With over 7 years of experience in SQL, PowerShell, and .NET, I specialize in reverse-engineering undocumented systems and automating complex enterprise workflows[cite: 5, 6].

### Professional Philosophy

I believe in "Orchestration vs. Engine"—using the right tool for the job. I use PowerShell for user-facing CLI logic and C# for performance-critical data handling. [cite_start]My background with a **BA in English** ensures that my technical solutions are backed by high-quality, standardized documentation[cite: 45, 13].

### Core Technical Stack
